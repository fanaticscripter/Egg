          Sorry, this is not possible. The game's API does not expose this information anywhere. If

          The solid darker green bar

          is projected total production before contract expiration. You can hover over or click on
          the progress bar to reveal more details in a tooltip. In general, many UI elements can be
          hovered over or clicked on to reveal more information.

          Is population growth taken into account in projections?

        <dd class="mt-1 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
          Unfortunately no. For coops, the game's API simply does not expose enough information to
          make it possible. For non-coops, it is possible to predict population growth if the game
          is kept offline, but potential active play (which disturbs internal hatchery calm) and the
          fact that the game syncs at unpredictable moments makes projection unreliable, and
          considerable over-projection possible in some common scenarios. Therefore, the feature is
          not implemented for now out of an abundance of caution. With enough user interest, this
          feature can be reconsidered.
